notes for wednesday october 8th:-

- I collected data for palm hills company and egx 30 for the same dates and they are very close.

- I looked into dimensionality reduction and decided to try out princibal component analysis since it is fairly simple and easy to interpret.

- after reading alittle about it through wikipedia I found an excellent youtube tutorials about PCA using R starting from the ground up.

- I made scripts to apply PCA on a data frame with only numeric columns and to draw colored pairs.

- unfortunately the technique doesn't show interesting relationships. 

- I suggest using different data and combining egx30 with palm
